# Autopush

Mozilla Push server and Push Endpoint utilizing Rust, Actix, and
a key/value data store.

This is the fourth generation of Push server built in Mozilla Services, and is built to support the the [W3C Push
spec](http://w3c.github.io/push-api/index.html).

For how to read and respond to **autopush error codes**, see
[Errors](errors.md).

For an overview of the Mozilla Push Service and where autopush fits in,
see the [Mozilla Push Service architecture
diagram](architecture.md#architecture).
This push service uses [websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) to talk to Firefox, with a Push
endpoint that implements the [`WebPush`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8030.html) standard for its `http` API.

## Autopush APIs

For developers writing mobile applications in Mozilla, or web developers using Push on the web with Firefox.
